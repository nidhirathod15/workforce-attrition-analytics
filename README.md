# Workforce Attrition Analytics
## Overview

This project presents a **Power BI–based workforce analytics dashboard** designed to analyze employee attrition patterns across departments, tenure groups, income bands, and performance ratings.
The objective is to **identify high-risk employee segments** and derive **data-driven implications** that can inform targeted retention strategies.

The analysis focuses on **business decision-making**, not predictive modeling.

## Business Context
Employee attrition has direct implications on:
* Talent continuity
* Operational costs
* Productivity and performance
This dashboard enables stakeholders to **move from descriptive metrics to actionable workforce insights**, supporting strategic HR and leadership decisions.


## Business Questions, Insights & Implications
### 1. Which departments exhibit the highest attrition risk?
Attrition is **unevenly distributed across departments**, with certain functions (notably Sales) showing consistently higher attrition rates compared to others.

**Solution:** A one-size-fits-all retention strategy may be inefficient. Departments with elevated attrition require **targeted interventions**, such as role-specific engagement programs, workload evaluation, or incentive restructuring.

### 2. How does attrition vary across employee tenure?
Employees within the **0–2 years tenure group** experience the highest attrition, with attrition rates declining significantly as tenure increases.

**Solution:** Early-career attrition indicates potential gaps in **onboarding, role clarity, or early engagement**. Strengthening first-year employee experience can significantly improve overall retention.

### 3. Is compensation level associated with attrition?
Attrition rates are highest within **lower income bands**, while higher income bands demonstrate greater retention stability.

**Solution:** Compensation competitiveness appears to influence retention outcomes. Periodic pay benchmarking and targeted compensation reviews may reduce attrition among vulnerable income segments.

### 4. Are only low performers leaving the organization?
Attrition is **not limited to low performers**. Mid-to-high performance employees also exhibit notable attrition rates.

**Solution:** Retention risk extends beyond performance management. Organizations may need **differentiated retention strategies** for high-value talent, including career progression visibility and recognition mechanisms.

### 5. Where should leadership prioritize retention efforts?
Departments combining **high attrition, lower average income, and shorter average tenure** represent the highest immediate risk areas.

**Solution:** Leadership focus should prioritize **high-risk segments identified through combined metrics**, enabling efficient allocation of retention resources and minimizing preventable talent loss.

## Tools & Techniques
* Power BI
* Power Query (data cleaning & feature engineering)
* Data modeling and aggregation


## Notes
This project uses a **static, enterprise-style HR dataset** to demonstrate workforce analytics and insight generation approaches commonly applied in real-world organizational contexts.


## Key Takeaway
Attrition is driven by a **combination of tenure, compensation, and departmental factors**, rather than a single variable.
Targeted, segment-specific retention strategies are likely to be more effective than broad, organization-wide initiatives.
